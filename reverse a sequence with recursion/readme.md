Let us consider the problem of reversing the n elements of a sequence S, so that the first element becomes the last, the second element becomes second to the last and so on. This can be achieved by swapping the first and last elements and then recursively reverse the remaining elements. When **start === stop**, the implicit range is empty, and when **start == stop-1**, the implicit range has only one element. In either case, there is no need for action as a sequence with 0 elements or one element is trivially equal to its reversal.
