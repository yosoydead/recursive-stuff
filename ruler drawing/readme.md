For each inch, we place a tick with a numeric label. We denote the length of the tick designating a whole inch as the **major tick length**. Between the marks for whole inches, the ruler contains a series of **minor ticks**, placed at intervals of 1/2 inch, 1/4 inch and so on. As the size of the interval decreases by half, the tick length decreases by one.

```
